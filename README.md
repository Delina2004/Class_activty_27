# Bookstore Inventory Management System

## Description
This project is a C++ program designed to manage a public bookstore's inventory. It allows bookstore staff to add, find, update, and remove books efficiently. The system keeps track of each bookâ€™s title, author, ISBN, and quantity, providing an organized way to manage inventory.

## Features
- **Add Books**: Add new books to the inventory or update the quantity of an existing book.
- **Find Books**: Search for a book by ISBN.
- **Display Inventory**: View all books in the inventory with details such as title, author, ISBN, and quantity.
- **Remove Books**: Remove a book from the inventory by ISBN.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three files:
1. **Store.h** - Contains the structure definitions for `Book` and `Store`, as well as function declarations.
2. **Store.cpp** - Implements the functions declared in `Store.h`.
3. **main.cpp** - The main program file that demonstrates the functionality of the `Store` class.

## Code Overview

- Represents a book with attributes:
  - `title` (string)
